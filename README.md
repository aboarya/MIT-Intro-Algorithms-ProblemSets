## Introduction

This repository holds implementations of the algorithms described in the [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/index.htm) in both `python` and `c++`

## Peak Finding

A peak in a 1-d array is any integer at index __i__, such that __i-1 < i > i+1__.  We are only concerned with finding __any__ peak in the 1-d array vs. all peaks.

A peak in a 2-d array is a hill in the matrix, such that the elemnt (j,j) is greather than all elements in north, south, east and west of it.
